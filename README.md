## Zapier Typescript Types Testing Issue Demo

This demo is for github issue https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform/issues/8

### Install

```bash
yarn
```

### Build

```bash
yarn build
```

### Run Tests

```bash
yarn zapier-test
```

## To simulate the issues I am having as described in the github issue...

* Navigate to `src/test/index`
* Comment or uncomment the `PERFORM 1` and `PERFORM 2` functions to see the response the typescript compiler has
* Run `yarn build` to see typescript compile errors (or view errors in your ide)

More details about the issues exist in `src/test/index` and on the associated github issue
